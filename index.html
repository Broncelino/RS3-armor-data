        <h1>What does it do?</h1>
        <p>The site will allow the custom input of the equipment <br>
            you want and display the defense, health, prayer, strength, 
            range, and magic bonuses of any combination of equipment. <br>
            Runescape players are very practical people so the design will be 
            simple to use in order to cut down on any words that have to be on the page.</p>

        <h1>Why?</h1>
        <p> Currently the game runescape doesn't have any good, public tools 
        to create equipment builds that display the stats of the equipment. <br>
        The only thing that is commonly used is the wiki that shows the stats 
        of completed sets of armor.<br> This works for some cases but sometimes 
        you will be mixing and matching equipment from different sets of armor. <br>
        The only other way to do this would be to buy the equipment in game 
        which can be very expensive or do all the calculations yourself wasting time.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>How</h1>
        <p>
        The site will use an sql database I created and converted into a json file. It will pull from the file
        to get all the data for the equipment.<br> The User will only need to know the name 
        of the equipment they want to wear and will be able to use a dropdown menu/search bar 
        to find any piece they want to see.
