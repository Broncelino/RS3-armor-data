      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Currently the game runescape doesn't have any good, public tools 
        to create equipment builds that display the stats of the equipment. 
        The only thing that is commonly used is the wiki that shows the stats 
        of completed sets of armor. This works for some cases but sometimes 
        you will be mixing and matching equipment from different sets of armor. 
        The only other way to do this would be to buy the equipment in game 
        which can be very expensive or do all the calculations yourself wasting time.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>People who play RuneScape that want to check the stats of equipment without buying it themselves.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The site will allow the custom input of the equipment 
        you want and display the defense, health, prayer, strength, 
        range, and magic bonuses of any combination of equipment. 
        Runescape players are very practical people so the design will be 
        simple to use in order to cut down on any words that have to be on the page.

        to create equipment builds that display the stats of the equipment. 
        The only thing that is commonly used is the wiki that shows the stats

      </ul>
      <h3>how</h3>
      <p>
        The site will use an sql database I created and it will pull from the database
        to get all the data for the equipment. The User will only need to know the name 
        of the equipment they want to wear and will be able to use a dropdown menu/search bar 
        to find any piece they want to see.
